# Med-Track Backend

A backend service that provides drug information by integrating with the FDA's drug label API. This service allows users to search for drugs by brand name, retrieve specific drug details by ID, and list all available drugs with pagination. The system supports three types of users: patients, pharmacies, and admins.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (for user authentication)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd med-track/backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=3000

## üîí Authentication and Authorization

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. Protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### User Types and Access Control

The system supports three types of users with different permissions:

1. **Patient**

   - Can view and update their own profile
   - Can access drug information
   - Can only be created through public registration

2. **Pharmacy**

   - Can view and update their own profile
   - Can access drug information
   - Can only be created by an admin

3. **Admin**
   - Has full access to the system
   - Can create pharmacy accounts and other admin accounts
   - Can access all endpoints
   - Can only be created by another admin

### Creating the First Admin User

For the initial system setup, you'll need to create the first admin user manually. You can temporarily modify the registerHandler in src/controller/auth.ts to allow creating an admin for the first time, or insert directly into the MongoDB database.
